CARE-CA Hybrid Causal LLM Framework: Our approach combines the explicit, structured causal reasoning of ConceptNet knowledge graphs coupled with counterfactual sentences to improvise the causal understanding of LLMs. This novel architecture aims to surpass traditional decoder or encoder-only models by leveraging the rich semantic knowledge base of ConceptNet with advanced contextual inference capabilities and ’alternate scenarios’ of the contextual sentences to further aid the LLMs in understanding the causality of scenarios.

Critical Components of the CARE-CA Framework:
1. Contextual Knowledge Integrator (CKI): CKI enriches the AI’s reasoning process with relevant external knowledge from databases like ConceptNet, providing a deep contextual backdrop against which causal relationships can be examined.
2. Counterfactual Reasoning Enhancer (CRE): CRE introduces hypothetical ‘what-if’ scenarios to test and refine the AI’s causal inferences, ensuring that identified causal links are robust and not merely correlational.
3. Context-Aware Prompting Mechanism (CAPM): CAPM crafts tailored prompts that encapsulate enriched context and counterfactual insights, directing Large Language Models toward more precise and accurate causal reasoning.
